\section*{Question 5}

Let $L$ be a regular language over an alphabet $A$.
Prove that the set of all words $z \in A^*$ for which there exist $u,v \in L$ such that $u = zx$ and $v=yz$ for some $x,y \in A^*$ is a regular language.

\subsection*{Solution}

We assume $S_1$ as set of all words $z \in A^*$ for which there exist $u \in L$ such that $u=zx$ for some $x \in K \subseteq A^*$.
We can represent $S_1$ as shown in Equation \ref{Eq1}.

\begin{equation}\label{Eq1}
	S_1 = LK^{-1} = \{z\in A^* | \exists x\in K, zx\in L\}
\end{equation}

Also, we assume $S_2$ as set of all words $z \in A^*$ for which there exists $v \in L$ such that $v = yz$ for some $y \in K \subseteq A^*$.
We can represent $S_2$ as shown in Equation \ref{Eq2}.

\begin{equation}\label{Eq2}
	S_2 = K^{-1}L = \{z\in A^* | \exists y\in K, yz\in L\}
\end{equation}

It has been proven \cite{simovici1999theory} that for every language $K$, both the right and the left quotients $LK^{-1}$ and $K^{-1}L$ are regular, if $L$ is a regular language over alphabet $A$.
Based on this theorem, $S_1$ and $S_2$ would both be regular.

Since any word $z \in A^*$ for which there exist $u,v \in L$ such that $u = zx$ and $v=yz$ for some $x,y \in A^*$ should be an element of $S_1$ and $S_2$, set of all such words will be the intersection of $S_1$ and $S_2$.
As regular languages $\mathcal{R}$ are closed with respect to intersection, it is proven that the desired set is a regular language.

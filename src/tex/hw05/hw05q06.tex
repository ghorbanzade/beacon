\section*{Question 6}

Give a counter-example to the conjecture that if a directed graph $G$ contains a path from $u$ to $v$, and if $u.d < v.d$ in a depth-first search of $G$, then $v$ is a descendant of $u$ in the depth-first forest produced.

\subsection*{Solution}

Any directed graph $G$ with a path from $u$ to $v$ through the source vertex $s$ would be considered as counter-example for the proposed statement. Figure \ref{fig61} depicts graph $G$ with source vertex $a$ as one counter-example following required conditions.

\tikzstyle{vertex}=[circle,draw,minimum size=0.7cm]
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[vertex] (1) {a};
    \node[vertex] (2) [below left = 0.5cm and 1.5cm of 1] {b};
    \node[vertex] (3) [below right = 0.5cm and 1.5cm of 1] {c};
    \path[draw,thick,->]
	(1) edge [bend left=30] (2)
	(1) edge (3)
    (2) edge [bend left=30] (1)

    \path[draw,ultra thick,->]
    ;
  \end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

Starting from $a$, node $a$ is visited first, and vertices $b$ and $c$ are discovered and placed in queue. In next step, if $b$ is the first node to be visited, the depth-first search algorithm will follow by discovering children of $b$. Since $b$ has only one child that is already visited, the depth-first search algorithm continues by visiting vertex $c$. In this case, although there is a path from $b$ to $c$ and $b.d < c.d$, $c$ is not a descendant of $b$.

\section*{Question 3}

Give an example of a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, a source vertex $s \in V$, and a set of tree edges $E_\pi \subseteq E$ such that for each vertex $v \in V$, the unique simple path in the graph $(V, E_\pi)$ from $s$ to $v$ is a shortest path in $G$, yet the set of edges $E_\pi$ cannot be produced by running BFS on $G$, no matter how the vertices are ordered in each adjacency list.

\subsection*{Solution}

Figure \ref{fig31} provides an example of a graph $G = (V, E)$ in which $E_\pi$ can be chosen as either $\{(a,b), (a,c), (b,d), (c,d)\}$ or $\{(a,b), (a,c), (b,e), (c,d)\}$. Taking node $a$ as the source vertex, $E_\pi$ will immediately ensure a unique shortest path from $a$ to all other nodes.

    \node[vertex] (4) [right = 1.5cm of 2] {d};

Applying the breadth-first algorithm to graph $G$ starting from vertex $a$, will result into the Figure \ref{fig:sfig3-1} after one step (visiting vertex $a$). At step 2, one of nodes $b$ or $c$ must be visited. Due to symmetry of the graph which ensures no loss of generality, suppose node $b$ will be visited. Since both nodes $b$ and $c$ are connected to nodes $d$ and $e$, any such visit will put nodes $d$ and $e$ in queue, adding edges $(b,d)$ and $(b,e)$ to the set of tree edges. In next step of algorithm, vertex $c$ will be visited. However, since all vertices connected to $c$ are already placed in queue, the visit will not affect the set of tree edges. Hence, full implementation of the BFS algorithm will result in Figure \ref{fig:sfig3-2}.

Therefore, regardless of the order of adjacency lists, no implementation of the breadth-first search algorithm will generate $E_\pi$ as set of tree edges.

\section*{Question 2}

Consider a database schema with three relations:\\

\texttt{Movies (\underline{movie\_id}:integer, title:string, year:integer, studio:string)}\\
\texttt{Actors (\underline{actor\_id}:integer, name:string, nationality:string)}\\
\texttt{StarsIn(\underline{actor\_id}:integer, \underline{movie\_id}:integer, character:string)}\\

The keys are underlined in each relation. Relation \texttt{Movies} stores information such as unique movie identifier, title, year and  producing studio. \texttt{Actors} contains unique actor identifier, actor name and nationality. Relation \texttt{StarsIn} tracks which actor starred in which movie, and the name of the character interpreted in that movie. Assume that one actor plays at most one character in the  same movie.

Write relational algebra expressions for the following queries:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the titles of movies produced by \textit{Universal} studio.

\textbf{Solution:}
$$\displaystyle \pi_{title}(\sigma_{studio="Universal"}Movies) $$

\item Find the names of actors that played a character named \textit{Forrest Gump} in some movie.

\textbf{Solution:}
$$\displaystyle \pi_{name}(\pi_{actor\_id}(\sigma_{character="Forest\ Gump"}StarsIn)\Join Actors)$$

\item Find the names of actors of nationality \textit{German}.

\textbf{Solution:}
$$\displaystyle \pi_{name}(\sigma_{nationality="German"}Actors)$$

\item Find the nationality of actors who played a character named \textit{Forrest Gump} or who starred in a movie in year 1980.

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A1 includes IDs of actors who played a character named \textit{Forest Gump}.
$$ \rho(A1,\pi_{actor\_id}(\sigma_{character="Forest\ Gump"}StarsIn))$$
\item A2 includes IDs of actors who starred in a movie in year 1980.
$$ \rho(A2,\pi_{actor\_id}(\pi_{movie\_id}(\sigma_{year=1980}Movies)\Join StarsIn))$$
\item Desired list includes nationality of actors whose ID is either in A1 or A2.
$$ \pi_{nationality}((A1\cup A2)\Join Actors)$$
\end{enumerate}

\item Find the names of actors that star in exactly one movie.

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A1 includes IDs of actors never starred in any movie.
$$ \rho(A1,\pi_{actor\_id}Actors-\pi_{actor\_id}StarsIn) $$
\item A2 includes IDs of actors starred in more than one movie.
$$ \rho(S1(1\rightarrow actor\_id1,2\rightarrow movie\_id1,3\rightarrow character1),StarsIn) $$
$$ \rho(S2(1\rightarrow actor\_id2,2\rightarrow movie\_id2,3\rightarrow character2),StarsIn) $$
$$ \rho(A2(1\rightarrow actor\_id),\pi_{actor\_id1} (S1 \Join_{(actor\_id1=actor\_id2) \wedge (movie\_id1\neq movie\_id2)} S2)) $$
\item Desired list includes names of actors who are neither in A1 nor in A2.
$$ \pi_{name}((\pi_{actor\_id}Actors - A1 - A2) \Join Actors)  $$
\end{enumerate}

\item Find the names of actors who starred in some movie in or after year 1980, but who did not star in any role (ever) for a movie produced by \textit{Universal} studio.

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A1 includes IDs of actors who starred in some movie in or after year 1980.
$$ \rho(A1,\pi_{actor\_id}(\pi_{movie\_id}(\sigma_{year>1979}Movies) \Join StarsIn)) $$
\item A2 includes IDs of actors who starred in some role for a movie produced by \textit{Universal} studio.
$$ \rho(A2,\pi_{actor\_id}(\pi_{movie\_id}(\sigma_{studio="Universal"}Movies) \Join StarsIn)) $$
\item Desired list includes names of actors whose ID is in A1 and not in A2.
$$ \pi_{name}((A1-A2)\Join Actors) $$
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

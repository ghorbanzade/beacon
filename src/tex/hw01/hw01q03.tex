\section*{Question 3}

Prove that $\log_a x = O(log_b x)$ for any $a > 0$ and $b > 0$.

\subsection*{Solution}
It suffices to introduce two constants $c$ and $x_0$ such that

\begin{equation}
\log_a x \leq c\times \log_b x
\label{eq7}
\end{equation}

for any $x \geq x_0$.
To make Equation \ref{eq7} into equality, $c$ is obtained as

\begin{equation}
c = \frac{log_a x}{log_b x} = log_a b
\end{equation}

Thus Equation \ref{eq7} is valid for all $x > x_0 = 0$ and for any $c \geq log_a b$.

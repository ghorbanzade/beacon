INTRODUCTION

    This repository contains the source code developed for Object-Oriented
    Software Development course at University of Massachusetts Boston.
    It includes solutions to 28 problems.

BUILDING

    The package(s) needed for building source code on ubuntu trusty
    platform are listed below.

        - ant
        - oraclejdk8

    Once you have all packages, all you need is `make` to build all source
    codes and documentations.

    The build automation tool is configured to build the source code,
    package programs in separate jar files, run all unit tests, measure
    code coverage and initiate a number of other software development
    tools such as javadoc, checkstyle, pmd and findbugs.

RUNNING

    Once the build process is complete, you can execute each program by
    adding the path to its jar file in classpath of `java` command and
    providing the name of its `*Main.java` class as its argument, as
    shown in the following example:

        java -cp UMB-CS681-2016S-hw01.jar edu.umb.cs681.hw01.CarMain

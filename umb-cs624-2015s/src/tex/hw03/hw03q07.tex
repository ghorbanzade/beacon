\section*{Question 7}

Suppose $T$ is a rooted tree with root $r$ and $x \neq r$ is a vertex in $T$.
Further, suppose $a$ and $b$ are both ancestors of $x$.
And to make things simple, suppose that $a \neq b$.
Prove that either $a$ is an ancestor of $b$ or $b$ is an ancestor of $a$.

\subsection*{Solution}

Proof is given by contradiction.
Assume distinct nodes $a$ and $b$ have no ancestorhood relationship.
Since they are ancestors of $x$ however, there exists a path of the form $r \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow a \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow x$ that does not pass node $b$.
Similarly, there exists a path of the form $r \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow b \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow x$ that does not pass from node $a$.
This leads to a simple loop of the form $r \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow b \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow x \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow a \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow r$ which contradicts definition of the tree.
Therefore initial assumption does not hold true and any path of the form $r \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow a \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow x$ would pass node $b$ at some point.
Hence either $a$ is an ancestor of $b$ or $b$ is an ancestor of $a$ and the proof is complete.

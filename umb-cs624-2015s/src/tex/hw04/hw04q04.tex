\section*{Question 4}

Prove that if $T$ is an optimal binary search tree and if $T'$ is any subtree of $T$, then $T'$ is an optimal binary search tree for its nodes.

\subsection*{Solution}

Proof is given by contradiction.
Assume that $T'$ with nodes $n_i$ to $n_j$, is not an optimal binary search tree.
This means nodes $n_i$ and $n_j$ can construct a binary search tree $T''$ whose expected cost is less than that of $T'$.
As the same nodes form a subtree inside $T$, implementing the new binary search tree $T''$ will lead to less expected total tree cost; the later, directly violates our original assumption that $T$ was an optimal binary search tree.
Therefore the initial assumption is false and $T'$ is an optimal binary search tree.

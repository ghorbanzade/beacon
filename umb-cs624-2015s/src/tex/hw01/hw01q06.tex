\section*{Question 6}

Prove that if there are positive constants $a$ and $c$ such that
\begin{equation}
T(n) = \sum_{j=2}^{n}(a + (j-1)c)
\end{equation}
then there are constants $A$, $B$ and $C$ such that
\begin{equation}
T(n) = An^2 + Bn + C
\end{equation}
Of course, $A$, $B$ and $C$ depend on $a$ and $c$, but do not depend on $n$.
You should show also that $A > 0$.

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
T(n) &= \sum_{j=2}^{n}(a + (j-1)c)\\
&=(a-c)\sum_{j=2}^{n}1+c\sum_{j=2}^{n}j\\
&=(a-c)(n-1)+c\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-c\\
&=(0.5c)n^2+(a-1.5c)n-a
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Where $A = 0.5c$, $B = (a - 1.5c)$ and $C = -a$.
Since $c$ is positive, $A$ is positive as well.

\section*{Question 5}

Prove that to show a problem $A$ is NP-complete, it is enough to show that $A$ is in NP and $B \leq_P A$ for some problem $B$ that is NP-complete.

\subsection*{Solution}

By definition, if $B$ is NP-complete, for any problem $C$ in NP, $C \leq_P B$.
Therefore, based on our assumption that $B \leq_P A$ and using the transitive property of polynomial-time reduction, proved in Question 3, $C \leq_P B \leq_P A$ thus $C \leq_P A$.
Since we showed for a problem $C$ in NP, $C$ is polynomial reducible to $A$, $A$ is proved to be NP-complete.

\section*{Question 4}

Prove that all problems that are NP-complete are polynomially equivalent, in the sense that if $A$ and $B$ are NP-complete then $A \leq_P B$ and $B \leq_P A$.

\subsection*{Solution}

By definition, $A$ is NP-complete if and only if $A$ is in NP and for \textbf{any} problem $B$ in NP, $B\leq_P A$.
Proof is immediately attained by using assumptions that $A$ and $B$ are NP-complete, which means they are in NP.
Since $B$ is in NP, using the assumption that $A$ is NP-hard, we can obtain $B \leq_P A$.
Similarly, since $A$ is in NP, using the assumption that $B$ is NP-hard, we can write $A \leq_P B$.
Therefore, both NP-complete problems are equivalent.

\section*{Question 4}

Modify \texttt{pizza1} project to use a session variable for the room number and remove the mechanism previously implemented using hidden states. Elaborate your modifications.

\subsection*{Solution}

Changes made to allow \texttt{\$\_session} variable to replace the hidden inputs are as follows.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1mm]\parskip=0pt
\item The following is added to \texttt{pizza/index.php}.
\lstset{language=php}
\begin{lstlisting}
$session_start();
if (isset($_POST['room'])) {
  $_SESSION['room'] = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'room', FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
  if ($_SESSION['room'] == NULL) {
    $_SESSION['room'] = 1;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\item The following is removed from \texttt{pizza/index.php}.
\lstset{language=php}
\begin{lstlisting}
$room = filter_input(INPUT_POST,'room',FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
if ($room == NULL) {
    $room = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'room');
    if ($room == NULL || $room == FALSE) {
       $room = 1;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\item All instances of \texttt{\$room} are replaced by \texttt{\$\_SESSION['room']}.

\item \texttt{header("Location:.?room=\$room");} lines are replaced by \texttt{header("Location:.");}.

\item Hyperlink for \textit{Order Pizza} is changed from \texttt{?action=order\_pizza\&room=\$room} to\\ \texttt{?action=order\_pizza}.
\end{enumerate}
An online implementation of session variable is readily available at the following link.

\section*{Question 1}

I have setup a part of my personal website \href{http://ghorbanzade.com/cs637}{\texttt{Ghorbanzade.com/CS637}} as a development platform for assignments and projects of this course.
Questions that require programming in PHP are briefly explained and solutions are provided in form of interactive web pages.
The directory will serve as complimentary solution to assignments, in the hope that it will be useful for presentation and educational purposes in the future.

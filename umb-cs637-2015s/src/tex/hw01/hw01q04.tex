\section*{Question 4}

Write a simple PHP program that calculates future value of a potential investment based on key parameters investment amount, yearly interest rate and number of years.

\subsection*{Solution}

Desired PHP program has been developed on \href{http://ghorbanzade.com/cs637?p=2&s=1}{Ghorbanzade.com/637} under the name of \textit{Future Value Calculator} and is readily available for evaluation.

Following is the code snippet (slightly different than the one on the website) that calculates future value of an investment, upon submission of its related parameters.

\lstset{language=PHP}
\lstset{frame=tb}
\lstset{numbers=left}
\begin{lstlisting}
if (is_numeric($_POST['invest'])) {
	if (is_numeric($_POST['interest'])) {
		if (is_numeric($_POST['year'])) {
			$future_value = $_POST['invest'];
			for ($i = 1; $i <= $_POST['year']; $i++) {
				$future_value += $future_value * $_POST['interest'] * 0.01;
			}
			$future_value = number_format($future_value,2);
			echo "Future value is $$future_value";
		}
		else {
			echo "Year not valid.";
		}
	}
	else {
		echo "Interest rate not valid.";
	}
}
else {
	echo "Investment amount not valid.";
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{Question 5}
Write another simple non-web PHP program that counts and reports how many \textit{a}'s, \textit{e}'s, \textit{i}'s, \textit{o}'s and \textit{u}'s show up in a string set up at the start as \textit{this is a test, only a test}. Use an associative array with keys \textit{a}, \textit{e}, \textit{i}, \textit{o}, and \textit{u}. Use \texttt{strlen} function. You can test if a key exists in an associative array with \texttt{array\_key\_exists} function.

\subsection*{Solution}
Desired PHP program has been developed on \href{http://ghorbanzade.com/cs637?p=2&s=2}{Ghorbanzade.com/637} under the name of \textit{Vowel Counter} and is readily available for evaluation.

Following is a code snippet that analyzes a given string, upon its submission, and gives the number of occurrences of each specified vowel.

\begin{lstlisting}
	// Get the string submitted by user
	$string = $_POST['string'];
	// Initialize array of vowels
	$letter_desired = array("a","e","i","o","u");
	$list = array_fill_keys($letter_desired, 0);
	// Find occurance of each vowel
	for ($i=0; $i < strlen($string); $i++) {
		if (array_key_exists($string[$i], $list)) {
			$list[$string[$i]] += 1;
		}
	}
	// Sort array based on value in descending order 
	arsort($list);
	// Prepare message
	$result = "There are ";
	$i = 0;
	foreach ($list as $char => $number) {
		$result .= ($number == 0) ? "no" : $number;
		$result .= " '<i>$char</i>'";
		$result .= ($number != 1) ? "s": "";
		$i++;
		$result .= ($i == count($list)-1) ? " and " : ", ";
	}
	$result .= "in specified string.";
	// Output message
	echo $result;
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{Question 6}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item In C, Java, and PHP, a non-negative integer constant consisting of a sequence of two or more digits is taken to be octal if the first digit is zero, Write a call to \texttt{preg\_match()} that checks if a string represents a non-negative octal number.

\item An octal number can be negative, with a minus sign before the digits. Write a call to \texttt{preg\_match()} that checks if a string represents an octal number.

\item A sequence of digits preceded by \texttt{0x} or \texttt{0X} is taken to be a hexadecimal integer, possibly preceded by a minus sign. The hexadecimal digits include \texttt{a} or \texttt{A} through \texttt{f} or \texttt{F} with values \texttt{10} through \texttt{15}. Write a call to \texttt{preg\_match()} that checks if a string represents a hexadecimal number, possibly negative.

\item Write a pattern that will match strings that are  either \texttt{messages} or \texttt{messages} followed by a dot character and a number. Write a call to \texttt{preg\_match()} that checks if a string represents this pattern.

\item A C-style comment is a sequence of characters that begin with \texttt{/*} and ends with \texttt{*/}. C-style comments do not nest. Write a call to \texttt{preg\_match()} that checks if the variable \$line represents a C-style comment.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Pattern \verb/(^[0]\d+$)/ will match all non-negative octal numbers as desired. The following code snippet shows how this pattern can be used inside the \texttt{preg\_match()} PHP function.

\lstset{language=php, tabsize=2}
\begin{lstlisting}
$pattern = '(^[0]\d+$)';
preg_match($pattern, $string);
\end{lstlisting}

\item Pattern \verb/(^[-]?[0]\d+$)/ will match all octal numbers as desired. The following code snippet shows how to use this pattern to check if \$string contains a string literal representation of an octal number.

\lstset{language=php, tabsize=2}
\begin{lstlisting}
$pattern = '(^[-]?[0]\d+$)';
preg_match($pattern, $string);
\end{lstlisting}

\item Pattern \verb/(^[-]?[0][x|X][0-9a-fA-F]+$)/ will match all string lateral representations of hexadecimal numbers. The following code snippet shows how to use this pattern to check if \$string contains a string literal representation of a hexadecimal number.

\lstset{language=php, tabsize=2}
\begin{lstlisting}
$pattern = '(^[-]?[0][x|X][0-9a-fA-F]+$)';
preg_match($pattern, $string);
\end{lstlisting}

\item Pattern \verb/(^\bmessages\b(?:[.]\d+)?$)/ will match string literals that begin with word \textit{messages} and may continue with a dot character followed by any number. The following code snippet shows how to use this pattern in PHP to see if an string literal matches the pattern.

\lstset{language=php, tabsize=2}
\begin{lstlisting}
$pattern = '(^\bmessages\b(?:[.]\d+)?$)';
preg_match($pattern, $string);
\end{lstlisting}

\item The simple pattern \verb#(\/\*.*\*\/)# would succeed in matching single-line block comments that are not nested. To resolve the nesting limitation, pattern \verb#(\/\*(\*(?!\/)|[^*])*\*\/)# is proposed. This pattern would match all single-line block comments. To further remove the limitation, pattern \verb#(\/\*([^*]|[\r\n]|(\*+([^*\/]|[\r\n])))*\*\/+)# is proposed that supports multi-line c-style block comments as well.

\end{enumerate}

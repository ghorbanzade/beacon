\section*{Question 2}

Let $a$ and $b$ be integer-valued attributes that may be \texttt{NULL} in some tuples.
For each of the following conditions that may appear in a \texttt{WHERE} clause, describe exactly the set of $(a,b)$ tuples that satisfy the condition, including the case where $a$ and/or $b$ is \texttt{NULL}.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $a=10$ or $b=20$
\item $a=10$ and $b=20$
\item $a<10$ or $a>=10$
\item $a=b$
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution:}

For ease of representation, sets $I$ and $J$ are defined respectively as set of integers and nullable integers; the latter being set of all possible integer values and the \texttt{NULL} value, $\lambda$.
As well, set of all binary relations that satisfy specified condition is defined as $S$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item
\begin{equation}\nonumber
S = \{ (a,b) | a = 10, b\in J \} \cup \{ (a,b) | b = 20, a\in J \}
\end{equation}
\item
\begin{equation}\nonumber
S = \{ (a,b) | a = 10, b = 20 \}
\end{equation}
\item
\begin{equation}\nonumber
S = \{ (a,b) | a \in I, b \in J\}= J - \{(a,b)|a = \lambda , b \in J\}
\end{equation}
\item
\begin{equation}\nonumber
S = \{ (a,b) | a = b, a \in I, b \in I\}
\end{equation}

\end{enumerate}
